         <p id="head1">Marvel Comics is an American media and entertainment company regarded as one of the “big two” publishers
         in the comics industry. Its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
         Disney Company. Its headquarters are in New York City.It is dubbed in many languages such as Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.

         <h3 style="color:blue ;"> Iron Man (2008)</h3>
             <p id="head2" > Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced 
             by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures,[N 1] it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic
             Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby,
             and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence 
             Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, and Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a
             terrorist group, world famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor
             and becomes the superhero Iron Man.A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures,
             20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights
             in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing.
             Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the

         <p id="head3">The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. Produced by Marvel Studios
             and distributed by Universal Pictures, it is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Louis 
             Leterrier from a screenplay by Zak Penn, and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner alongside Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson,
             Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate 
             the "Super-Soldier" program through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of 
             the Hulk. After the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though 
             Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man for Marvel, was brought onboard 
             and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007,
              Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a reboot of the series, distancing 
              it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from 
              July to November 2007, primarily in Toronto, Canada, with additional filming in New York City and Rio de Janeiro</p>

         <p id="head15">Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt 
            Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he 
            wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as neurosurgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, 
            Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a 
            career-ending car crash.Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until Paramount Pictures 
            acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were brought on board in June 2010 to write 
            a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 
            2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought 
            Cargill on to help. Principal photography on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York 
            City in April 2016.Doctor Strange had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, as part of 
            Phase Three of the MCU. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide and was met with praise for its cast, visual effects, and musical score. 
            The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, was released in May 2022.</p>

            began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing 
            campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for Avengers: Endgame prior to its April 2019 release.

            film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and 
            Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 
            2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was released in 
            December 2021. </p>

             take on the mantle and powers of Thor whilst suffering from cancer. Robinson joined to contribute to the script in February 2020, and further casting was

             because of a contractual obligation. Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, this was the first 
             attempt at a theatrical release since the Captain America serial of 1944.Lucas proposed adapting the comic book following the production of American 
             Graffiti (1973). After multiple production difficulties and mixed response to test screenings, Howard the Duck was released in theaters on August 1, 1986. 
             Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, and was criticized for its humor, performances, inconsistent tone, and the appearance of 
             the title character, though the effects and soundtrack were mostly praised. In the years since, it has been considered among the worst films of all time, 
             but has also developed a cult following.[4][5] It was nominated for seven Razzie Awards (winning four), and made about US$38 million (US$15 million 
             domestically) compared to its US$30–37 million budget.</p>

             Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.Development of X-Men began as far back as 1984 with Orion Pictures, with James Cameron and 
             Kathryn Bigelow in discussions at one point. The film rights were bought by 20th Century Fox in 1994, and various scripts and film treatments were 
             commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon, and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, 
             Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie, and Hayter, in which Beast and Nightcrawler were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. X-Men marked the

            Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origins and early superhero career. After being 
            bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teenage genius Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked identity to fight 
            crime and injustice in New York City, facing the villainous Green Goblin in the process.Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. 
            Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in 
            development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release 
            by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. 
            Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John 
            Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in 
            final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, 
            and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg 
            during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January 
            to June 2001. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the film's visual effects.</p>

             Jennifer Garner plays his love interest Elektra Natchios; Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye; David Keith plays Jack "The Devil" Murdock, 
             a washed up fighter and Matt's father; and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin.The film began development in 1997 
             at 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures, before New Regency acquired the rights in 2000. Johnson shot the film primarily in Downtown Los Angeles despite 
             the Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan setting of the film and comics. Rhythm and Hues Studios were hired to handle the film's CGI. Graeme Revell composed the 
             Daredevil score, which was released on CD in March 2003, whereas the various artists' soundtrack album, Daredevil: The Album, was released in February.
             Daredevil was released on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, with praise aimed at the action sequences, acting 
             performances, soundtrack, storyline, visual style and stunts, while criticism was aimed at Affleck's performance and its perceived lack of ambition. 
             Nevertheless, the film became the second-biggest February release to that time and went on to a worldwide total gross of $179.2 million against a 
             production budget of $78 million.A spin-off sequel film, Elektra, was released in 2005 to critical and commercial failure. In 2004, an R-rated director's
             cut of Daredevil was released, reincorporating approximately 30 minutes of the film, and reviews were more positive than for the theatrical version. A 
             sequel was planned, but because of Elektra's failure, it was scrapped and was rebooted as a television series from 2015–2018.</p>

             Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Kelly Hu, and Anna Paquin. Its plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, concerns the genocidal Colonel 
             William Stryker leading an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro, in order to destroy 
             every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the Brotherhood of Mutants, their former enemies, to stop 
             Stryker and save the mutant race.Development on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released in 2000. David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote 
             separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually 
             hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before 
             being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Return to Weapon X and God Loves, Man Kills. 
             Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside 
             of Los Angeles. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film.</p>

             sequel to 2003's X2, as well as the third installment in the 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, and was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Simon 
             Kinberg and Zak Penn. It features an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammer, James 
             Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Vinnie Jones and Patrick Stewart. The film's script is loosely based on two X-Men comic book story
             arcs: "The Dark Phoenix Saga" by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne, and "Gifted" by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday, with a plot 
             that revolves around a "mutant cure" that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans, and on the resurrection of Jean Grey.Bryan Singer, who had 
             directed the two previous films, X-Men (2000) and X2, decided to leave the sequel to work on Superman Returns. X2 composer John Ottman and X2 writers Dan 
             Harris and Michael Dougherty also left to work on Superman Returns, as did James Marsden, who had very limited screen time in The Last Stand before his 
             character was killed off due to his departure from the film. Singer had not even defined the storyline for a third film. Matthew Vaughn, who was initially 
             hired as the new director, left due to personal and professional issues, and was replaced with Ratner. Filming took place from August 2005 to January 2006 
             with a budget of $210 million, and was consequently the most expensive film made at the time of its release. It had extensive visual effects created by 11 
             different companies.</p>

         <p id="head51">Spider-Man 3 is a 2007 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. It was directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by Raimi, 
             his older brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent. It is the final installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and the sequel to Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 
             (2004). The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas 
             Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. The film also marks the final film appearance of Cliff Robertson before his retirement and 
             death in 2011. Set a year after the events of Spider-Man 2, the film follows Peter Parker as he prepares for his future with Mary Jane Watson, while facing 
             three new villains: Uncle Ben's true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes Sandman after a freak accident; Harry Osborn, his former friend, who is now aware of
             Peter's identity and seeks to avenge his father; and Eddie Brock, a rival photographer who subsequently transforms into Venom. Peter also faces his 
             greatest challenge when he bonds with an extraterrestrial symbiote that increases his abilities but amplifies his anger and other negative traits.
             Development of Spider-Man 3 began immediately after the successful release of Spider-Man 2 for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally 
             wanted two villains, Harry Osborn and Sandman. At the request of producer Avi Arad, he added Venom to the list and the producers also requested the 
             addition of Gwen Stacy. Principal photography for the film began in January 2006, and took place in Los Angeles and Cleveland before moving to New York 
             City from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, Sony Pictures 
             Imageworks created over 900 visual effects shots. With an estimated production budget of $258–350 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the 
             time of its release.</p>

             from Galactus.The film was released on June 15, 2007 in North America. Despite a slightly improved critical reception from the first film, it also grossed 
             less at the box office than its predecessor. A third film was planned, but due to conflicts between the director and Jessica Alba, and the producers having 
             trouble finding a new director for a planned Silver Surfer spin-off, the franchise ended up in development hell.[3][4] The series was rebooted in 2015 with 
             the release of Fantastic Four to poor critical and commercial reception. Marvel Studios eventually claimed the film rights of the characters after the

         <p id="head55">X-Men: First Class (stylized on-screen as X: First Class) is a 2011 American superhero film based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is 
             the fourth mainline installment in the X-Men film series and the fifth installment overall. It was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer, 
             and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, January Jones, Oliver Platt, and Kevin Bacon. At the time of its release, it was 
             intended to be a franchise reboot[7] and contradicted the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009); however, the follow-up film X-Men: Days of Future Past 
             (2014) retconned First Class into a prequel to X-Men (2000). First Class is set primarily in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and focuses on the 
             relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and the origin of their groups—the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, respectively, as 
             they deal with the Hellfire Club led by Sebastian Shaw, a mutant supremacist bent on enacting nuclear war.Producer Lauren Shuler Donner first thought of a 
             prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of X2; producer Simon Kinberg later suggested to 20th Century Fox an adaptation of the comic series 
             X-Men: First Class, although the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both X-Men and X2, became involved with the project in 
             2009, but he could only produce and co-write First Class due to his work on other projects. Vaughn, who was previously attached to both X-Men: The Last 
             Stand and Thor, became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner Jane Goldman. First Class replaced a Magneto prequel film 
             that had been in development, but had entered development hell; the Writers Guild of America arbitration gave a story credit to Magneto writer Sheldon 
             Turner. Principal photography began in August 2010 and concluded in December, with additional filming completed in April 2011. Locations included Oxford, 
             the Mojave Desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 
             1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.</p>

             gain superhuman abilities. It was the first Fantastic Four film that Bernd Eichinger did not produce due to his death in 2011.After Fantastic Four: Rise of 
             the Silver Surfer (2007) disappointed at the box office, Fox announced plans to reboot the franchise, and development of the film began in 2009. Trank was 
             hired to direct in July 2012 and the principal characters were cast in January 2014. Principal photography began in May 2014 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and 
             lasted for two months. Dissatisfied with the director's original cut, Fox executives mandated reshoots, which took place in January 2015.Fantastic Four 
             premiered at Williamsburg Cinemas in New York City on August 4, 2015, and was released on August 7 in the United States. The film was panned by critics, 
             with criticism aimed at the dark tone, direction, acting, editing, lack of humor, character development, pacing, writing, unfaithfulness to the source 
             material, story, visuals and CGI though there was some praise for the musical score and some performances. It grossed $168 million worldwide against a 
             production budget of $155 million, losing 20th Century Fox over $80 million, becoming a box office bomb. At the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, it won 
             several awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture. Trank also voiced his displeasure with the final film, blaming the studio's interference.</p>

             X-Men film series and the eighth installment overall. Directed by Tim Miller from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, it stars Ryan Reynolds in 
             the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man who gave him 
             mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the antihero Deadpool.Development of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, 
             before he played the character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Reese and Wernick were hired for a spinoff in 2010 and worked with Reynolds to adapt 
             the character more faithfully (including his fourth wall breaking) after the portrayal in Wolverine was criticized. Miller was hired in 2011, marking his 
             directorial debut. An enthusiastic response to leaked test footage he created with Reynolds led to a green-light from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began 
             in early 2015, and filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May of that year. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, 
             ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CG character Colossus.Deadpool was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, 
             after an unconventional marketing campaign. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $782 million against a $58 million 
             budget, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including highest-grossing X-Men film and R-rated film at the time. 
             Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, along with its action sequences, though some criticized the plot as 
             formulaic and were divided on the film's adult humor. It received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Awards and two Golden Globe 
             nominations. A sequel, Deadpool 2, was released in 2018 to comparable critical and commercial success. Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by 
             Disney, a third film is in development at Marvel Studios.</p>

             screenplay by Jeff Pinkner, Scott Rosenberg, and Kelly Marcel, it stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom alongside Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott 
             Haze, and Reid Scott. In the film, struggling journalist Brock gains superpowers after becoming the host of an alien symbiote, Venom, whose species plans 
             to invade Earth.After Venom's appearance in Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony attempted to develop a spin-off film based on the character but it did not move 
             forward due to issues with Sony's ongoing Spider-Man franchise. In March 2016, work began on a new version that would start a new shared universe 
             featuring the non-Spider-Man Marvel characters that the studio possessed film rights to. Sony also intended for Venom to share the world of the Marvel

             timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's "The Dark Phoenix Saga" in a future film that would be more 
             faithful than his previous attempt with The Last Stand, which was met with a mixed reception, with even Kinberg and co-writer Zak Penn ultimately 
             unimpressed with the film. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to Apocalypse in 2016. Kinberg signed on as director in June 2017, with the

         <h3 style="color: blue;"> Captain America (1944) </h3>
         <p id="head72">Captain America is a 1944 Republic black-and-white 15 chapter serial film loosely based on the Timely Comics (now Marvel Comics) character Captain America. 
             It was the last Republic serial made about a superhero. It also has the distinction of being the most expensive serial that Republic ever made. It stands 
             as the first theatrical release connected to a Marvel character; the next theatrical release featuring a Marvel hero would not occur for more than 30 
             years. It was the last live-action rendition of a Marvel character in any media until Spider-Man appeared in the Spidey Super Stories segment of the 
             children's TV series The Electric Company in 1974.The serial sees Captain America, really District Attorney Grant Gardner, trying to thwart the plans of 
             the Scarab, really museum curator Dr. Cyrus Maldor - especially regarding his attempts to acquire the "Dynamic Vibrator" and "Electronic Firebolt", 
             devices that could be used as super-weapons.In a rare plot element for Republic, the secret identity of the villain is known to the audience from the 
             beginning, if not to the characters in the serial. The studio's usual approach was the use of a mystery villain who was unmasked as one of the other 
             supporting characters only in the final chapter.</p>

         <p id="head74">Set after the events of Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk,[2] Phil Coulson informs Jasper Sitwell that the World Security Council wishes for Emil Blonsky
             to be released from prison to join the Avengers Initiative. They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in Harlem on Bruce Banner. The Council 
             orders them to ask General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross to release Blonsky into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. As Nick Fury does not want to release Blonsky, the 
             two agents decide to send a patsy to sabotage the meeting. Coulson reluctantly sends "The Consultant", Tony Stark, and (as partially depicted in the 
             post-credits scene of The Incredible Hulk) Stark approaches the disgraced Ross while he is drinking in a bar. Stark annoys Ross so much that he tries to 
             have Stark removed from the bar, until Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan 
             worked and Blonsky will remain in prison.At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced that The Consultant would appear exclusively on the Thor 
             Blu-ray release on September 13, 2011. It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold.[2] The short was filmed 
             over 2–3 days.[17] Clark Gregg and Maximiliano Hernández return to portray Agent Phil Coulson and Agent Jasper Sitwell, respectively, from the films.
             [2][18] They are joined via archive footage by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / The Consultant, William Hurt as General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, and 
             Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky in his Abomination form.[18] Co-producer Brian Winderbaum said the producers "wanted to paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling 
             the strings and being responsible for some of the events seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first 
             S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first Iron Man film?"[2] Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that 
             warned him Coulson would die in The Avengers. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to "build the audience'
             s relationship [with] him" and make his death in the film more impactful. The Consultant was written after A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's 
             Hammer, due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget "for two guys talking". To help with 
             this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in Thor, and had him and Coulson "brainstorming a way to deal with this red tape 
             bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative".[</p>

             because he takes the time to change into his Deadpool costume first.Shortly before the release of the 2017 film Logan, its theatrical runtime was extended

             humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun 
             of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.No Good Deed was originally released by 20th Century Fox in front of Logan on 
             March 3, 2017, and an alternate version of the short was released online by Reynolds the following day. Responses to the short praised it as a tease for
